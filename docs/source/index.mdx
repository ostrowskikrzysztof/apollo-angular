description: What is Apollo Angular?
---

**Apollo Angular** is a complete state management library for JavaScript apps. Simply write a GraphQL query, and Apollo Angular will take care of requesting and caching your data, as well as updating your UI.

Fetching data with Apollo Angular guides you to structure your code in a predictable, declarative way consistent with modern React best practices. With Apollo, you can build high-quality features faster without the hassle of writing data plumbing boilerplate.

Apollo Angular can be used in any JavaScript frontend where you want to describe your data using GraphQL. It's:

## Features

- **Declarative data fetching:** Write a query and receive data without manually tracking loading states
- **Excellent developer experience:** Enjoy helpful tooling for TypeScript, Chrome DevTools, and VS Code
- **Designed for modern React:** Take advantage of the latest React features, such as hooks
- **Incrementally adoptable:** Drop Apollo into any JavaScript app seamlessly
- **Universally compatible:** Use any build setup and any GraphQL API
- **Community driven:** Share knowledge with thousands of developers, thanks to our active open source community

These docs will help you to go from getting started with Apollo to becoming an expert!

## Get Started

Follow the [quick start tutorial](/) to start fetching data in minutes. For a longer end-to-end example that includes pagination, local state management, and building a graph API, check out the [official Apollo tutorial](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/angular/tutorial/introduction/).

## Explore Apollo Angular

The Apollo Angular docs are structured into the following sections. We recommend starting with the Essentials first before moving on to advanced topics.

1. **Essentials:** Start here to learn how to fetch data, update data, and manage local state with Apollo Angular
2. **Features:** Learn how to get the most out of Apollo Angular's features
3. **Advanced:** Advanced Apollo Angular capabilities to cover all your needs
4. **Recipes:** How-to guides for accomplishing specific tasks
5. **API:** Full API details for Apollo Angular, its React APIs, and additional packages

Getting started is as simple as installing a few libraries from [npm](https://npmjs.org)! The [setup](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/angular/basics/setup/) is a good place to start your adventure with Apollo!

### Compatible tools

We want you to love working with Apollo Angular, so we work extra hard to make sure it works with the client or server tools you're already using! The maintainers and contributors focus on solving the hard problems around GraphQL caching, request management, and UI updating, and we want that to be available to anyone regardless of their technical requirements and preferences for other parts of the app.

### The Angular toolbox

Apollo is lovingly designed to work nicely with all of the tools used by today's Angular developers. Here are some in particular:

- **Angular Schematics**: Apollo Angular supports `ng-add` and `ng-update` (migrations soon)
- **NativeScript**: Apollo works out of the box in NativeScript.
- **Angular Router**: Apollo Angular is completely router-independent, which means you can use it with any version of [Angular Router](https://github.com/angular/angular) or any other routing library for Angular. It's even easy to set up [server-side rendering](/recipes/server-side-rendering/).
- **Ionic**: Apollo works great with [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/) apps written in Angular

If you have a favorite Angular tool, and something in Apollo makes it difficult to integrate, please open an issue and let's work together to make it work nicely and add it to the list!

### GraphQL servers

We believe that using GraphQL should be easy and fun. One of the ways Apollo is designed for this is that if you can write your query in GraphiQL, it'll work with Apollo Angular! Because it doesn't assume anything beyond the official GraphQL specification, Apollo works with every GraphQL server implementation, for _every_ language. It doesn't impose any requirements on your schema either! If you can send a query to a standard GraphQL server, Apollo can handle it. You can find a list of GraphQL server implementations on [graphql.org](http://graphql.org/code/#server-libraries).

### Other JavaScript + native platforms

This documentation site is written with examples using Angular, but Apollo has an implementation for every client platform:

- JavaScript
  - [React](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/)
  - [Vue](https://github.com/Akryum/vue-apollo)
  - [Meteor](/recipes/meteor/)
  - [Ember](https://github.com/bgentry/ember-apollo-client)
  - [Polymer](https://github.com/aruntk/polymer-apollo)
- Native mobile
  - [Native iOS with Swift](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/)
  - [Native Android with Java](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android)
